# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Introduction
This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. It utilizes a webcam to monitor the driver's facial expressions and detect signs of drowsiness based on eye behavior.

## Prerequisites
Before running this system, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- dlib
- scipy
- numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

Additionally, you'll need the pre-trained facial landmark detector file (`shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`). You can download it from the following link:
[Pre-trained Facial Landmark Detector](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)

Extract the file and place it in the same directory as the Python script.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed and the pre-trained facial landmark detector file is available.
3. Run the `drowsiness_detection.py` script using Python.
4. A webcam window will open, monitoring the driver's facial expressions in real-time.
5. If drowsiness is detected (e.g., eyes closed for an extended period), an alert will be displayed.
